# Directory
A simple app for http://iosdevdirectory.com

This was really just a few hours work, so I don't know if I'll ever get around to doing anything more on the app, but I thought it was worth sharing nonetheless.

# Roadmap

I've created a few issues already, feel free to make other suggestions.
